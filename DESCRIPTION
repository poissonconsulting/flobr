Description: Converts files to and from flobs. 
    A flob is a file that was 
    read into binary in integer-mode as little endian, 
    saved as the single element of a named list (where the name is the name 
    of the original file) and then serialized before being coerced into a blob.
    Flobs are useful for writing and reading files to and from databases.
