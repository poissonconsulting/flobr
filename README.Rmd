## Introduction

`flobr` is an R package to convert a file to and from a flob.

A flob is a file that was 
read into binary in integer-mode as little endian, 
saved as the single element of a named list (where the name is the extension
of the original file) and then serialized before being coerced into a blob.

Flobs are useful for saving files in databases.
    
## Utilisation

```{r}
library(flobr)

path <- system.file("extdata", "flobr.pdf", package = "flobr")

flob <- flob(path)
flob
flob_ext(flob)

new_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".pdf")

unflob(flob, new_path)

all.equal(flob, flob(new_path), check.attributes = FALSE)
```
