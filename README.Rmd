## Introduction

`flobr` is an R package to convert files to and from flobs.

A flob is a file that was 
read into binary in integer-mode as little endian, 
saved as the single element of a named list (where the name is the name of the original file including its extension) and then serialized before being coerced into a blob.

Flobs are useful for writing and reading files to and from databases.

## Demonstration

```{r}
library(flobr)

path <- system.file("extdata", "flobr.pdf", package = "flobr")

flob <- flob(path)
str(flob)
flob_name(flob)
flob_ext(flob)

unflob(flob, tempdir())

all.equal(flob, flob(file.path(tempdir(), "flobr.pdf")), check.attributes = FALSE)
```
