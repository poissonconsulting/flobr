# flobr 0.2.0

By default flobs now include the original file name with the extension. 

To read with a different file name use the name argument to `flob()`.
The saved file name can be accessed using `flob_name()`.

To write with a different file name use the name argument to `unflob()`.

If the flob was read using a previous version of flobr which means it lacks a file name then by default it is written with the file name "file".
